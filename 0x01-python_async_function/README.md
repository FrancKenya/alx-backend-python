Async Operations Project
This project is all about understanding asynchronous programming in Python. We explored key concepts like dynamic programming, prime factorization, code optimization, and the greedy algorithm to create a robust asynchronous solution using Python's asyncio library.

Summary
Project Overview
The main objective of this project was to create a series of async functions that utilize Python's asyncio library to handle asynchronous operations efficiently. We aimed to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a goal using concepts like dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.

Requirements

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
All your files should end with a new line
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
